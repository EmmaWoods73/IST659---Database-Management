# IST659---Database-Management

The aim of this project is the design and implementation of a database in order to solve a business data management problem.  
Following identification of stakeholders and the data they will need to access and maintain, the database is constructed
in order to answer five data questions.

The project document outlines all design specifications detailing the data to be tracked and how the elements work together. 
Also specified are business rules that dictate how the data is to be managed.

Implementation of the database design is also described, including SQl statements used to create the tables
and columns to constrain the data, and the database rules used.

All code written in SQL.
